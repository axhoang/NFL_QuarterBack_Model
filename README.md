# NFL Quarterback Performance Prediction Model

Welcome to the NFL Quarterback Performance Prediction Model repository! This project aims to dive deep into the analytics of NFL quarterbacks, utilizing historical data to predict future performances. By leveraging advanced statistical techniques and machine learning models, we explore the nuances that define successful quarterback play.

## 🏈 Project Overview

The NFL Quarterback Performance Prediction Model is designed to forecast the success metrics, such as touchdown passes, for NFL quarterbacks in upcoming games or seasons. This model uses data from past seasons, incorporating various player statistics to identify patterns and predict outcomes with a focus on enhancing understanding and strategy formulation for teams and fans alike.

## 🌟 Why This Project?

Quarterback performance is a pivotal element of football, often determining the outcome of games and, by extension, seasons. By predicting quarterback performance:

- **Teams** can make better strategic decisions, from play calling to player transactions.
- **Fans and analysts** gain insights that enhance their understanding and enjoyment of the game.
- **Fantasy football players** and **bettors** can make more informed decisions, potentially increasing their success rates.

## 💻 What's Inside This Repository?

Here’s what you’ll find in this repository:

- `Quarterback_model.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing all the analysis, from data cleaning to model training and evaluation.
- `passing_cleaned.csv` and `quarterback_stats.csv`: Datasets used for analysis, featuring comprehensive statistics on quarterback performance.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and guide to the repository.

## 🚀 Features of the Model

- **Data-Driven Insights**: Extracts deep insights from historical data.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Uses linear regression, decision trees, or neural networks (adjust based on actual methods used) to predict touchdowns.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assess model accuracy with metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R-squared.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**: For all backend computation and data manipulation.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data handling.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## 📊 How to Use This Model

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required Python libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt` (ensure to include a `requirements.txt` file in your repo).
3. Run `Quarterback_model.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to see the model in action.

## 📈 Contribute
